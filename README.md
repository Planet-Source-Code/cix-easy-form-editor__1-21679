### Description

Hey people it's me agian. ;-)

This littel program make it easy for you too make a shaped form.

You just draw(with the mouse) on the form and click save, then the program saved the shape and

writes a *.frm file for you to use in VB. It all so exports the picture you drawn so you can make it fansy in photoshop or something like that, and then use it as your bagground in your form.
